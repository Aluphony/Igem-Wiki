      <div class="paragraph">
        Alzheimer's disease, an affliction of profound neurological consequence,
        stands as a progressive disorder primarily characterised by the erosion
        of cognitive faculties, notably memory, cognition, and comportment.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        The development of a disease stage classification for Alzheimer's
        disease (AD) has been a complex process, and there is no complete
        consensus on the existing systems in place. The definitive staging of
        the disease remains a subjective decision made during
        clinical-pathological discussions involving clinicians,
        neuropsychologists, and pathologists. A significant limitation of the
        staging system is its approximate applicability to living subjects, as
        AD pathology is typically confirmed post-mortem. Therefore, a clinical
        diagnosis of probable AD is often used. The absence of a diagnostic test
        for AD during a person's lifetime greatly hinders research into the
        disease's mechanisms and poses challenges for clinical trials, as it
        introduces additional variability in the patient population. Testing
        therapeutics is challenging, particularly if they need to be
        administered before the disease reaches a specific, unclear stage or if
        the patient group is poorly defined. [1]
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        AD diagnosis typically relies on the presence of two hallmark
        pathologies: the extracellular plaque deposits of the β-amyloid peptide
        (Aβ) and the neurofibrillary tangles formed by the microtubule binding
        protein tau. For many years, researchers were perplexed by the weak or
        non-existent correlation between the amount of neuritic plaque pathology
        in the human brain and the severity of clinical dementia. There is now
        substantial evidence indicating that the solubility of Aβ and the
        quantity of Aβ in different pools may be more closely associated with
        the disease's progression
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Several potential theories regarding the progression of Alzheimer's
        disease (AD) include chronic neuronal stress, convergence of factors,
        hypoxia, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, the presence of
        multiple pathologies, oxidative stress, and nutrient deprivation. These
        interconnected and complex pathologies contribute to synaptic loss and
        neuronal death, creating a self-perpetuating feedback loop that cannot
        be halted.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Amyloid beta peptides are produced through the sequential cleavage of
        the transmembrane protein APP by β- and γ-secretases, known as the
        amyloidogenic pathway. γ-secretase is a tetramer composed of PSEN1 or
        PSEN2, APH-1, nicastrin, and PEN-2. Mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2
        influence the length of Aβ peptides, often resulting in longer Aβ42
        peptides, which are abundant in AD senile plaques alongside normal Aβ40
        peptides.
      </div>
      <div class="images">

          style="width: 100%; height: 100%" />
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that when neuronal cell
        lines and primary neurons are cultured under hypoxic conditions, they
        exhibit an overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and produce
        significant amounts of Aβ. Hypoxia occurs when cellular oxygen levels
        drop to around 0.5-5%, leading to insufficient oxygen and acetyl-CoA for
        mitochondria. This results in the increased generation of reactive
        oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), causing intracellular
        stress. Interestingly, heightened mitochondrial ROS production inhibits
        PreP, impeding the degradation of Aβ and causing its accumulation within
        the mitochondrial matrix.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Oxidative damage is most prominent in the early stages of the disease
        and diminishes as the disease progresses, correlating with increased
        brain Aβ levels. These findings have led to the theory that oxidative
        stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
        Additionally, the presence of high levels of Aβ bound to metal ions
        within mitochondria is associated with elevated ROS levels. Notably,
        markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress have been detected in blood,
        cerebrospinal fluid, and urine during both early and late stages of AD,
        suggesting their constant presence throughout the disease's progression,
        potentially serving as valuable biomarkers to track the disease's
        trajectory. [2]

      <div class="paragraph">
        Alzheimer's disease is more prevalent among older individuals, and as
        the global population continues to age, there will be a higher number of
        people at risk. By 2050, it is estimated that the number of individuals
        with Alzheimer's disease may triple, primarily due to the aging
        population. There has been a growing awareness of Alzheimer's disease in
        recent years, leading to more people seeking diagnosis and treatment. As
        a result, more cases are being identified, and the prevalence of the
        disease is increasing. As the number of people affected by the disease
        increases, so does the cost of care, including medical treatment,
        caregiving, and support services.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        The disorder has no cure, and its rate of progression is variable.
        Further, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the early phase is
        difficult, and there are no specific laboratory or imaging tests to
        confirm the diagnosis. Alzheimer's disease is a systemic disorder and
        creates havoc in the family. These individuals often wander, fall, have
        significant behavioural problems and loss of memory. The majority of
        patients end up in geriatric care institutions because they become
        difficult to manage at home. [3]

      <div class="paragraph">
        Incidence rates per 1000 person–years for AD with CDR 0.5 were 3.24 (95%
        CI: 1.48–6.14) for those aged 65 years and 1.74 (95% CI: 0.84–3.20) for
        those aged 55 years. Standardised against the age distribution of the
        1990 US Census, the overall incidence rate in those aged 65 years was
        4.7 per 1000 person–years. [4]

      <div class="paragraph">
        India is experiencing rapid population ageing, with projections
        indicating that nearly 20% of its population, or 319 million people,
        will be aged 60 or older by 2050. This demographic shift reflects
        increasing life expectancy, which has risen from 42.9 years in 1960 to
        70.4 years in 2020. Life expectancy at birth ranges from 64.8 years in
        Bihar to 75.1 years in Kerala. Expected survival at age 60 is 17.4 years
        for men and 18.9 years for women. The estimated dementia prevalence
        among individuals aged 60 and older in India is 7.4% (95% confidence
        interval [CI], 6.4 to 8.5), and age-standardised dementia prevalence is
        8.0% (95% CI, 6.8 to 9.2). [5]

      <div class="paragraph">
        <b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</b> is a non-invasive medical
        imaging technique that uses powerful magnetic fields and the behavior of
        hydrogen nuclei (protons) in the body to create detailed internal
        images. Protons align with or against the magnetic field. An applied
        radiofrequency pulse disrupts this alignment, causing a temporary
        reversal of proton spins known as "excitation," which releases energy.
        RF signals emitted during relaxation are captured by coils around the
        body, and computer processing generates precise images, aiding in
        accurate medical diagnoses. Using MRI technique, it is now possible to
        distinguish atrophy during the early stage of AD from the atrophy of
        normal ageing. Discrimination of AD from other forms of dementia,
        namely, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and DLB (dementia with Lewy
        bodies) is also possible based on different atrophy patterns that MRI
        reveals. MRI does not directly visualise or quantify beta-amyloid
        plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Detecting these plaques
        typically requires specialised PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans
        with amyloid-specific radiotracers. MRI scans can be uncomfortable and
        challenging for Alzheimer's patients, especially those prone to anxiety
        or claustrophobia, as they require lying still in a confined space for
        an extended period.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <b>Computed Tomography (CT)</b> scan, also known as CAT (Computerised
        Axial Tomography) scan is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays
        and computer processing to create cross-sectional images of the body's
        internal structures. CT scans are invaluable in diagnosing and
        monitoring a wide range of medical conditions. CT scanning is based on
        the principle of X-ray absorption. When X-rays pass through the body,
        they are absorbed to varying degrees by different tissues, depending on
        their density. Dense tissues like bones absorb more X-rays and appear
        white on the CT images, while less dense tissues like organs and fluids
        appear in various shades of grey, with air appearing black. CT primarily
        provides detailed images of brain structures but may not reveal early
        cellular or metabolic changes associated with the disease making them
        less sensitive. Brain atrophy can be caused by various conditions, not
        just Alzheimer's disease, making it challenging to differentiate between
        different neurodegenerative disorders solely based on CT imaging.

      <div class="paragraph">
        <b>Cerebrospinal fluid test</b> - A CSF test for Alzheimer's disease is
        typically performed using a lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture is a
        procedure in which a thin needle is inserted into the lower back to
        collect a sample of CSF. The procedure is usually performed under local
        anaesthesia and takes about 30 minutes to complete. Once the CSF sample
        is collected, it is sent to a laboratory for testing. The laboratory
        will measure the levels of Aβ1-42, T-tau, and P-tau in the CSF. The
        results of the CSF test can help doctors to diagnose Alzheimer's disease
        and to differentiate it from other causes of cognitive impairment. CSF
        testing can also be used to monitor the progression of Alzheimer's
        disease and to track the response to treatment. Collecting CSF requires
        a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), which is an invasive procedure. This can
        be uncomfortable and carries a small risk of complications, including
        headaches or infection. Analysing CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease
        can be complex and requires specialised testing. Interpretation may vary
        between laboratories, leading to potential inconsistencies in results.

      <div class="heading">GERIATRIC CARE & INCLUSION</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        One of the central issues is the lack of awareness and understanding of
        Alzheimer's disease in India, both among the general population and
        within the healthcare system. Many people often confuse Alzheimer's
        symptoms with normal signs of aging, leading to delayed diagnosis and
        treatment. This lack of awareness also extends to the broader societal
        understanding of the specific care needs of Alzheimer's patients. As a
        result, there is a pressing need for public health campaigns and
        education programs to promote awareness, early detection, and
        destigmatize the condition.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Moreover, the existing healthcare infrastructure in India is
        ill-equipped to handle the increasing demand for specialised geriatric
        care and Alzheimer's treatment. Many healthcare facilities lack trained
        professionals and resources required for the comprehensive care of
        Alzheimer's patients. Additionally, there is a shortage of geriatric
        specialists, and the healthcare system tends to be more focused on acute
        care rather than long-term and palliative care, which is essential for
        Alzheimer's patients.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        In terms of inclusion, elderly individuals, particularly those with
        Alzheimer's, often face social isolation and neglect. The lack of
        community support, stigma surrounding mental health issues, and
        inadequate social services further exacerbate the problem. Family
        caregivers, who are usually forced to quit their jobs due to the lack of
        geriatric health care in India, often face significant physical,
        emotional, and financial stress due to the lack of support and respite
        services. This is a growing challenge in the face of urbanisation and
        nuclear families, and mostly, unfairly, takes more of a toll on the
        women of the family.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        So, early and accessible diagnosis can serve both as an important
        complement to the goal of raising awareness and also give families and
        our healthcare infrastructure sufficient time to plan and arrange the
        care our elderly require.
