                Alzheimer’s is very quickly becoming one of the biggest burdens on our healthcare systems. The specific
                nature of the kind of geriatric care and support required coupled with the predicted rise in cases makes
                us predict that it will be hard for current infrastructure to keep up with these changes. In India, in
                particular, the lack of awareness and discussion about the prevalence of the disease makes it
                particularly more delicate of a situation. The lack of trained professionals and institutions directly
                leads to loss of family income due to family members staying home to take care of their elderly. This
                also takes a psychological toll on the people involved closely. These factors worsen in India due to
                rapid urbanization and the slow disintegration of the joint family unit. India, also burdened by its
                milieu of taboos and regressive, developing regions with low exposure, suffers at the hands of people
                not understanding the neuropathologies of old age and ill–formed prejudices about what is expected of
                our elderly. This leads to a general stigmatization and resistance to getting tested. A lot of our
                communication, outreach, and human practices work then complements the purpose of solving our problem
                statement itself. As we attempt to precisely define the problem through the stakeholders involved and
                also raise awareness among vulnerable populations.

                The importance of science lies in its promise for the future. To ensure this future though, it becomes
                vital to ensure scientific knowledge is disseminated among aspiring students and learners and awareness
                about the potentials and most recent advances in available technologies be regularly and effectively
                communicated through the scientific community and an establishment of an extended kinship across the
                spectrum. Our primary aim is to educate and inspire a diverse audience about the exciting world of
                synthetic biology through workshops and educational initiatives.

                <div class="paragraph">
                    For this, our work was divided primarily along three axes:
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <b>Educational Workshops:</b> We conduct informative workshops designed to introduce synthetic
                    biology and
                    its multidisciplinary aspects to students, targeting everyone from the BTech audience of our college
                    to schools. These workshops challenge misconceptions and emphasize the significance of iGEM in
                    bridging the gap between academic knowledge and real-world applications. Our objective is to equip
                    students with practical skills, ignite their passion for science, and prepare them for future
                    careers in biotechnology and synthetic biology. The required content curation and modification to
                    suit the different types of audiences we targeted in all three levels we worked at, helped us create
                    different standardized and organized methods to describe the opportunities and scope of synbio in
                    different, specific terms tailored to the understanding level and also relatability of each
                    demographic involved
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <b>Media Outreach:</b> We harness the power of digital media and social platforms to increase
                    awareness
                    about synthetic biology and reach a wider audience, especially the younger generation. We utilize
                    social media platforms to share articles, surveys, and engaging posts about synthetic biology. Our
                    objective is to demystify the subject, debunk myths, and promote interdisciplinary research
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <b>Conferences: </b>Participation in the All India iGEM Conference allows us to network with
                    like-minded
                    individuals, share our insights, and learn from fellow iGEM teams. By exchanging ideas, and showcase
                    our work, our objective is to foster collaboration and broaden our knowledge base, all while sharing
                    our passion for synthetic biology and its potential to address real-world challenge
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    In summary, our efforts in workshops, media outreach, and conference participation are geared toward
                    promoting the understanding and significance of synthetic biology, inspiring the next generation of
                    scientists, and expanding our network within the iGEM community.

                In the context of our project in particular and the development of POC Diagnostic kits in low resource
                settings it becomes very important to directly involve with the stakeholders of the project and use that
                information we collect to reshape the design and implementation of our project so that our kit actually
                addresses the needs and gaps that currently exist in as comprehensive a way as possible.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                We engaged with experts to gain their opinions and formulate consolidated insights from all our
                interactions and finally apply them to our project as we moved forth in this journey. Throughout our
                research the focus points were:
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                1) Understanding the reason behind lack of awareness regarding Alzheimer among the general populace.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                a) We visited Haridwar and talked to a variety of people, especially the elderly, and asked them about
                their life, and Alzheimer patients, and caregivers.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                b) IISER Trivandrum, as per collaboration, visited a nearby Hospital for us, to understand about
                Alzheimer Patients and Caregivers.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                c) We conducted surveys to assess how much people are informed about existing provisions for detection,
                prevention, and effect of Alzhiemer in people’s life.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                2) Integrating human practices into coming up with ideas for developing the protocol for our kit
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                a) We talked to Neurologist and Professors to understand the Biomarkers involved in Alzhimer and potency
                of using Saliva as a biomarker

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                b) We participated in the All India iGEM Meet held in Bhopal where we presented our Project idea and
                working solution. We received invaluable feedback, and interesting suggestions for our kit which helped
                our project along the way.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                c) We conducted sessions with entrepreneurs and leading startups in the field to understand the impact,
                importance and scaling of our proposed solution.

                    We hope that our extensive work can help bring forth a difference in the detection of Alzhiemer
                    especially among the older populace. More importantly, we hope that our efforts would enable an open
                    dialogue on the raging issues of cognitive and social impacts of the disease especially in the low
                    resource areas. We hope that the Scientific and the Medical community will further use our work to
                    give viable inputs to create an inclusive, Open Medical System and an Awakened, Sensitive and Aware
                    Society.
