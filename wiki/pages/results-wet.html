              We encountered issues with the stability of several
              electrodes/fabricated sensors that were discarded due to rapidly
              changing DPV plots (perhaps due to leaching of the aptamers into
              the buffer).
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              The electrodes used were the ones that produced stable and
              constant DPV Values over repeated runs.

              <div class="paragraph">
                Work needs to be done for creating reproducible results with new
                batches of electrodes to ensure the stability of electrodes and
                a reliable immobilization protocol.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              One possible explanation for the leaching was that the discarded
              electrodes were mostly from a second batch of immobilization that
              was done a day after the reduction of the aptamers. Even though
              they were stored at -20C it is possible that they resolved back
              into their oxidized form with the disulfide bond, hindering
              effective immobilization
