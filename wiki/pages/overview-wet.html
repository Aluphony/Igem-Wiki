            <div class="paragraph">
              Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a powerful analytical
              technique used in various fields of science, particularly in
              biochemistry, chemistry, and drug discovery. It is primarily
              employed to measure the thermodynamic parameters of interactions
              between molecules in solution. ITC provides valuable information
              about binding affinity (Kd), enthalpy change (ΔH), entropy change
              (ΔS), and stoichiometry (n) of binding reactions. Here's a
              detailed overview of how ITC works and its applications:

              Principle of Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC):
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              ITC measures the heat changes associated with a binding reaction
              that occurs at constant temperature (hence the term "isothermal").
              The underlying principle relies on the fact that when molecules
              interact in solution, they can either release heat (exothermic) or
              absorb heat (endothermic), depending on the nature of the
              interaction.

            <div class="paragraph">
              The basic setup of an ITC instrument consists of two chambers: a
              sample cell and a reference cell. The sample cell contains one of
              the binding partners (typically the ligand), while the reference
              cell contains a similar solution without the binding partner. Both
              cells are kept at the same temperature, and a sensitive
              calorimeter measures the heat flow between them as the binding
              reaction progresses.

          <section id="" class="section">
            <div class="heading">How ITC Works:</div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Initial Equilibration: The experiment begins with the ligand
              (typically in the syringe) being titrated into the sample cell
              containing the macromolecule (usually a protein or nucleic acid).
              Both cells contain the same buffer to maintain constant
              conditions.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Titration: Small volumes of the ligand solution are injected into
              the sample cell in a controlled manner, typically in a series of
              steps. As the ligand mixes with the macromolecule, a binding
              reaction takes place.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Heat Exchange Measurement: Heat is either absorbed or released
              during the binding reaction, leading to temperature changes in the
              sample cell. The calorimeter detects these temperature changes and
              converts them into heat flow data.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Data Analysis: The heat flow data are then analyzed to determine
              the binding parameters, including the binding constant (Kd),
              enthalpy change (ΔH), entropy change (ΔS), and stoichiometry (n).

            <div class="paragraph">
              Determination of Binding Affinities: ITC is widely used to measure
              the binding affinities between various biomolecules, such as
              proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules. It can help identify
              the strength of molecular interactions, which is crucial in drug
              discovery and understanding biological processes
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Enzyme Kinetics: ITC can be used to study enzyme-substrate
              interactions and determine kinetic parameters, such as the
              Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and turnover number (kcat).
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Thermodynamic Studies: ITC provides insights into the
              thermodynamics of binding reactions, including ΔH and ΔS, which
              can shed light on the forces driving molecular interactions.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              Stoichiometry Determination: ITC can determine the stoichiometry
              of complex formation, i.e., the number of ligand molecules binding
              to a macromolecule. Screening for Ligand Binding: ITC can be used
              to screen potential drug candidates for their binding affinity to
              a target protein, helping in drug development.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
              In summary, isothermal titration calorimetry is a versatile
              technique that allows researchers to quantitatively study
              molecular interactions by measuring heat changes during a binding
              reaction. It is invaluable in understanding the thermodynamics of
              these interactions, which has wide-ranging applications in
              biology, chemistry, and pharmaceutical research.

              As part of our Wet Lab procedures for this project we’ve worked on
              optimizing the immobilization of our chosen Aptamer for
              Lactoferrin on Au-SPEs. Subsequently, we performed Electrochemical
              Response/Analyte Sensing Studies on a range of concentrations
              which include the Alzheimer’s detection and Healthy Person’s
              range, with the goal of establishing a linear relationship between
              the current and concentrations.

              The reduction of thiolated aptamers (that are shipped in an
              oxidized form to protect the thiol groups) is crucial to making
              the thiol groups available for binding with the gold surface of
              the Au-SPE (S-Au bonds). The procedure involves the reduction of
              disulfide bonds using Dithiothreitol (DTT) and subsequent removal
              of DTT.

            <div class="paragraph">
              The composition and concentration of the buffers and analytes were
              decided after extensive literature survey and consultation with
              experts in the field. All solutions, unless stated otherwise, were
              prepared in PBS Buffer (pH 7.4).

              4.78 + 1.11 μg/mL[1]. Accordingly, a range of 11 solutions of
              Lactoferrin were prepared for sensing with concentrations ranging
              from 0.1 - 16 μg/mL.

              MCH reduces the fouling properties of aptamers and prevents them

              upright (steric hindrance) and blocking the remaining electrode
              (S-Au bonds). A 1mM stock of this was prepared. Most literature

              Aptasensor fabrication procedures have been tailored based on the

              sensitivity of our sensors. Apart from using MCH as a spacer

              Our preliminary studies have served as a screening process,
              allowing us to identify the most stable and consistent sensors and
              methods for further experimentation. A scan rate study was
              conducted and 50mV/s was selected. As per the electrode studies,
              only sensors exhibiting stable aptasensor currents have been
              selected for subsequent investigations, ensuring reliability and
              reproducibility. Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) has been
              chosen instead of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) due to its superior
              signal-to-noise ratio and ability to distinguish between
              background currents.

              The fundamental principle of an Electrochemical Aptasensor is that
              the change in conformation on binding with lactoferrin would lead
              to a change in signal. So, Electrochemical Response
              Studies/Analyte Sensing Studies have been conducted to validate
              the aptasensors' performance under various 11 concentrations and
              different conditions. This helps us plot graphs describing how the
              aptasensor would behave when dealing with different
              concentrations. Different spacer choices, analyte volumes, etc.
              have been tested to ensure meaningful sensing within a specific
