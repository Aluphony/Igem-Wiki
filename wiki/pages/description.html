        Overview
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        As longevity increases worldwide, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is becoming
        more prevalent and poses a growing burden on our healthcare systems,
        both socially and economically. Current treatments for AD are mostly
        ineffectual palliative care. Management of AD is focused on caregiving
        and inclusion, the cost of which is over a trillion USD annually [1].
        Particularly in India, where deaths due to AD have increased five-folds
        in the last 30 years, little to no reliable infrastructure exists for
        geriatric care and the anticipated costs are extremely high. Several
        studies have identified risk factors of AD, like levels of education and
        cardiovascular diseases, that clearly explain the high incidence and
        burden of AD in several Indian states.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Characterized by an extremely long pre-clinical stage where
        neuropathological changes already begin to occur, studies have
        approximated nearly 416 million persons on the AD continuum [2].
        Usually, following a clinical diagnosis, the more definitive tests for
        AD include expensive medical imaging (CT, MRI, etc.) or the invasive
        quantification of certain biomarker levels in cerebrospinal fluid.
        Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more accessible AD diagnostic
        tool for vulnerable age groups, enabling regular testing. This would
        help both delay the onset of dementia and foster research and
        development of effective therapeutic tools right during the early
        stages.

      <div class="paragraph">
        The anticipated burden on our healthcare has fostered some urgent and
        important research in the last few years, revealing the presence of
        salivary biomarkers for AD. This could potentially rewrite the scope of
        early diagnosis and management of AD. Lately, biomarkers for several
        diseases that are otherwise difficult to diagnose are being discovered
        in easily accessible body fluids like saliva, sweat and tears. Research
        has made significant progress in verifying, quantifying, and
        physiologically explaining the presence of certain biomarkers of AD in
        saliva. The most promising of these are Amyloid Beta and Lactoferrin,
        with clear specificity for AD and p-values 0.001 [3, 4]..

          The project we’re developing this year is an aptamer-based diagnostic
          kit that allows rapid and convenient quantification of these
          biomarkers in saliva, facilitating early detection and intervention.
          We will be synthesizing and optimizing aptamers discovered through
          SELEX[5] by using in-silico methods and tools. The aim is to increase
          binding affinity of these aptamers and suit them more to our specific

        Alzheimer’s Disease
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Currently, more than 55 million people have dementia worldwide, over 60%
        of whom live in low- and middle- income countries [1]. Deaths due to
        dementia, after adjusting for old age, are estimated to be 1.5 million
        in 2019 alone [6]. These numbers are set to surge in the coming years
        with increasing longevity and aging populations. Alzheimer’s Disease is
        the leading cause of progressive dementia. India, particularly
        vulnerable to a lot of AD risk factors and life-style predispositions,
        urgently needs to direct more attention and resources towards the
        disease. These risk factors, including education levels, genetic
        diversity, rural majorities, cardiovascular diseases, and nutrient
        deficiencies vary disproportionately across the states and strongly
        correlate with estimated AD patients [7].

      <div class="paragraph">
        The effects of AD are deeply wound into our very social fabric.
        Neurodegenerative disorders have profound effects on the lives of
        patients as well as their loved ones. Having AD can be a deeply
        alienating experience as it drastically alters social dependencies,
        understandings, and how we relate to each other. For as long as no cure
        exists, management will rely on improving geriatric care and inclusion,
        posing growing social and economic challenges to our healthcare systems.
        Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and intervention,
        and also enables the development of therapeutic tools for these
        preclinical stages.

      <div class="paragraph">
        In India, cultural differences and lack of awareness have been
        identified as major challenges to tackle for the timely management of
        AD. One of the primary reasons for delayed diagnosis and inadequate care
        for AD is the common tendency to attribute certain symptoms to old age
        instead of dementia. Existing cognitive tests have been designed for
        English-speaking populations and don’t account for socio-cultural
        differences. The possibility of disintegrating joint-family systems
        decreasing cognitive engagement of the elderly and thus increasing the
        incidence of dementia is also being studied.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        One of the biggest costs of managing AD is that of informal care, i.e.
        family members staying home to support and take care of dependent
        elderly, and the consequent loss of family income. This is particularly
        high in India due to the lack of trained professionals in managing
        patients with AD and also in general geriatric care. This tends to
        disproportionately and unfairly affect the women in the families who are
        expected and forced to stay back at home. Thus, there’s an urgent need
        for the development of an easily accessible diagnostic tool, to screen
        elderly populations regularly for timely intervention and better
        planning of how to care for the patient.

        Lactoferrin is a globular glycoprotein that’s an important component of
        the innate immune system. It’s been detected in various secretory fluids
        like milk, saliva, tears, and nasal secretions. Decreased salivary
        levels of Lactoferrin (∼ 4.78 ±1.11 µg/mL) have been reported in
        patients with Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, studies have identified a
        strong correlation (>77%) between decreased salivary lactoferrin levels
        in seemingly healthy patients and their risk of developing Alzheimer’s
        or mild Cognitive Impairment [8].

        Amyloid Beta (Aβ) refers to a group of peptides that are found in
        extracellular gray matter deposits in the brains of patients with
        Alzheimer’s Disease. Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid is used in practice as
        a biomarker and collected through a lumbar puncture. However, as the
        procedure is invasive, recent research has focused on quantifying Aβ42
        levels in more easily accessible body fluids like saliva. Multiple
        studies have identified increased salivary levels of Aβ (∼ 127.11 ±33.44
        pg/mL) as biomarkers for AD with high specificity and sensitivity (AUC
        in ROC analysis= 0.806) [9].

        Aptamers
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Aptamers are short oligonucleotide or peptide sequences with high
        binding affinity for particular target molecules. Aptamers are rapidly
        replacing antibodies and most other target recognition systems in
        biosensors owing to their stability, versatility, sensitivity and
        inexpensive synthesis methods. There has been significant advancement in
        the development of aptamers against Lactoferrin and Amyloid Beta[5].
        Most of these are developed through the standard method of in vitro
        selection called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential
        Enrichment (SELEX). We intend to improve the binding affinity of these
        and particularly target some of our needs, like targeting the type of
        heterogeneous pool of Amyloid Beta oligomers found in saliva. The
        methods and in-silico tools we’ll be using for this are detailed in the
        next section.

      <div class="paragraph2" style="color: #842b6f">Aptasensors</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        The binding between an aptamer and a target molecule leads to a change
        in conformation of the aptamer structure which can be quantified through
        various colorimetric, fluorescence or electrochemical based
        techniques[10]. Aptasensors have become a reliable method for diagnosis
        of disease biomarkers as well as environmental pollutants and
        contaminants. The use of aptamers in Point of Care diagnostic kits
        particularly increased during the pandemic for the detection of
        SARS-CoV-2[11].
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        After going through various different aptamer designs, we have chosen an
        electrochemical based signal for our aptasensor. Electrochemical
        aptasensors, when combined with signal amplification techniques[12] can
        provide an easier way of quantifying the results. These can be
        integrated into a small POC device which measures the electrochemical
        signal in case of biomarker detection and performs signal amplification
        to provide user interpretable results. A switch-on-off electrochemical
        system can be developed by attaching an electron donating molecule such
        as ferrocene to one end of the aptamer which can then be immobilized on
        the respective electrode. Upon exposure to the target molecule, the
        aptamer instead binds to the target molecule, causing a change in
        conformation of the aptamer-biomarker complex. This causes a change in
        the electronic signal which can be amplified for further inference.

      <div class="paragraph">
        Electrochemical Analysis through Cyclic Voltammetry and DIfferential
        Pulse Voltammetry can quantify our biomarkers effectively within a
        specified linear range. This can be easily performed using a small
        portable potentiostat creating the scope for a Point-Of-Care device.

      <div class="paragraph2" style="color: #842b6f">Aptamers Design</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Over the last decade, aptamers have been used in various point-of-care
        diagnostic platforms including Aptamer-Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay
        (ALISA), Dot-blot, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays,
        fluorescence-based assays, nanoparticle-based assays, lateral flow test
        strips. Moreover, various aptamer-based diagnostic assays have exhibited
        the potential to follow the WHO's “ASSURED” criteria for point-of-care
        diagnostics: affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, robust, and
        can always be performed outside a laboratory or hospital by unskilled
        labor.[14]
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        Regardless of the intended application, high target affinity is a
        critical requirement of aptamers. However, aptamers with high affinities
        are not always isolated by conventional SELEX. Numerous reports show
        various techniques for improving affinities of aptamers including the
        optimization of various conditions such as buffer, ions, pH,
        temperature, and we would like to introduce other works for improvement
        of aptamers apart from these optimization of the environmental
        conditions. Limitation of Binding Affinity in the aptamers identified by
        SELEX reflect two major procedural flaws in SELEX- One is the limitation
        of molecular diversities in the initial library and the other is the
        loss of potential high affinity aptamers during polymerase chain
        reaction (PCR).The affinities of aptamers can be improved through
        sequence optimizations, and the understanding of sequence–activity
        relationships of existing aptamers can be used to improve the properties
        of other aptamers.[15]
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Aptamers fold into unique structures that usually include stems and
        loops. These structures are central to target molecule recognition and
        any disruptions result in poor binding abilities. Some streptavidin
        binding DNA aptamers that were generated from different libraries by
        different laboratories have the same bulge-hairpin secondary structure
        motif. Moreover, several nucleotides in the loop and bulge, which were
        critical for binding, were present in all high affinity sequences.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        We were able to find the aptamer sequences in the existing literature
        for our selected biomarkers for Alzheimer Disease - Beta Amyloid and
        Lactoferrin. We established a protocol of optimizing the aptamer
        sequences obtained through in-silico methods which involves utilizing an
        algorithm called MPDR(Mutate Predict Dock Repeat).

        1. Saliva Sample - Collection of samples from easily accessible body
        fluids such as saliva greatly expand the scope of diagnostic tools for
        rapid detection and quantification of biomarkers. This simplifies
        invasive testing procedures, reduces costs, and encourages people to get
        tested more.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        2. Early Detection- Salivary levels of our chosen biomarkers,
        Lactoferrin and Amyloid Beta, are reported to vary well before the onset
        of clinically observable dementia. This gives patients and their
        families enough time for intervention and planning management. 
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        3. Point-Of-Care- This extremely simplified and cost-effective procedure
        using a saliva sample and electrochemical sensor enclosed in a small
        device can be easily operated by any person. The accessibility, along
        with the advantage of rapidly obtainable results makes our kit an
        extremely useful alternative to existing diagnostic tools.
