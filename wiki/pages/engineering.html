              As not much Literature work has been done into the Simulation of
              Amyloid Beta Structures, 1IYT and 5KK3, we couldnâ€™t guess
              initially the Simulation time and conditions for the Protein
              structures, so we conducted a series of experiments to finally
              understand the simulation parameters.

              As we can see the graphs above, the Simulation for few structures
              is yielding highly unstable data, at 100 ns simulation time, which
              indicates we need to study the simulation for a longer time, but
              we also learned the simulation condition 0.15 M KCl and MgCl2 is
              an ideal as we are able to significantly reduce the RMSD as
              compared to first cycle. We need more cycles to fully understand

              Both CV and DPV were performed on fabricated electrodes and bare
              SPEs too. CV results didnâ€™t show much variation, and we werenâ€™t
              completely satisfied with the DPV results either as we thought we
              could optimize for a greater difference between the two currents.
              Some electrodes were giving unstable results as well. The current
              plots of the analyte sensing studies saturated after two
              concentrations.

              We interpreted the results to indicate possible fouling and
              blocking of electrode sites by the aptamer. The unstable
              electrodes also probably indicated leaching of aptamers (See Notes
              in Wet Lab Results Section) due to re-oxidation of thiol groups.
              The saturation of Aptamers with Lactoferrin was possibly due to
              the volume of Lactoferrin we used being more than available
              aptamers for binding.

              For successful detection of our biomarker we would have to either

              We decided to try a second immobilization protocol, this time
              co-immobilizing the initial DTT used to reduce the aptamer along
              with the aptamer. We had read about SAMs using DTT as well,
              proving to be more effective than MCH. [6]

              The same immobilization protocol was followed except DTT was
              co-immobilised with DNA:DTT ratio of 1:10. MCH was backfilled as a
              blocking agent after incubation overnight. This was then washed
              with PBS and incubated again before electrochemical analysis was
              done. This time, sensing studies were also performed subsequently.

              DPV was performed on the fabricated electrodes and bare SPEs. The
              DPV plots showed a significant increase in current (roughly 72Î¼A).
              However, on performing analyte studies (with 3Î¼L), it reached
              saturation current at 1Î¼g/mL itself.

              Even though much higher DNA:DTT ratios have been reported, the
              available aptamers for binding are clearly not sufficient for
              sensing. Perhaps our overall concentration of aptamer solutions
              must be optimized. It is possible that DTT was interfering with
              our sensing studies and not having the desired effect at all. We
              will continue to optimize these protocols until we can develop
              reproducible results.
